NAME
    Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI::XS - Fast ANSI image parsing

SYNOPSIS
        # The XS reader will automatically be used instead of the pure-perl version
        my $ansi = Image::TextMode::Format::ANSI->new
        $ansi->read( shift );

DESCRIPTION
    To parse an ANSI file, we use a simple state machine and examine each
    character individually. This proves to be a little on the slow side in
    pure-perl form.

    This module endeavors to re-implement the parsing in XS/C. The results
    show a major speed increase; about 25 times faster.

INSTALLATION
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

METHODS
  _read( $image, $fh, \%options )
    This is an XS-based version of Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI's method of
    the same name.

BENCHMARK
    Versus Image::TextMode 0.05, parsing 74K of ANSI 25 times yields:

        Benchmark: timing 25 iterations of PP, XS...
                PP: 24 wallclock secs (23.84 usr +  0.00 sys = 23.84 CPU) @  1.05/s (n=25)
                XS:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.00 CPU) @ 25.00/s (n=25)
             Rate    PP    XS
        PP 1.05/s    --  -96%
        XS 25.0/s 2284%    --
