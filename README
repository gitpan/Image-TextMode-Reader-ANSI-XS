NAME
    Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI::XS - Fast ANSI image parsing

SYNOPSIS
        # The XS reader will automatically be used instead of the pure-perl version
        my $ansi = Image::TextMode::Format::ANSI->new
        $ansi->read( shift );

DESCRIPTION
    To parse an ANSI file, we use a simple state machine and examine each
    character individually. This proves to be a little on the slow side in
    pure-perl form.

    This module endeavors to re-implement the parsing in XS/C. The results
    show a major speed increase; about 25 times faster.

INSTALLATION
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

METHODS
  _read( $image, $fh, \%options )
    This is an XS-based version of Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI's method of
    the same name.
